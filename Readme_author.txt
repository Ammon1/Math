
This is 1.0 version of spectroscopy program- by now very poor. It is just start of the project. 
Version 2.0 will have more tools for chart 1 and chart 2; more math functions like fitting Gaussian and Lorenzian functions. 
An answer of possible questions- yes, I know the program is not optimised, I'm still learning huw to do it please give me a time to learn.

How program runs:

1. Prepare data as follows:

clomn X [separator] colomn Y [separator]end of line
2. Choose separator: it may be Tab, Space, Coma and Dot. Other separators will not work
3. Load the data
3'. Now you can choose what is X,Y maximum and minimum value by typing in text boxes values
4. You may calculate differential of the function, what is dY not dX/dY
4'. Similar as before you may choose what is X,Y maximum and minimum value by typing in text boxes values

By now that's all.
