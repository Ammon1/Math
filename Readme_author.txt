This is 1.0 version of spectroscopy program- by now very poor. It is just start of the project. 
Version 2.0 will have more tools for chart 1 and chart 2; more math functions like fitting Gaussian and Lorenzian functions. 
An answer of possible questions- yes, I know the program is not optimised, I'm still learning huw to do it please give me a time to learn.
